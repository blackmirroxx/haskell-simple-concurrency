# Simple concurrency in Haskell

This repository contains translations of [Go by Example](http://gobyexample.com)'s concurrency chapters, as well as a lengthy tutorial which builds the reader up to them in much the same way as Go by Example.
You can follow along with [the tutorial](./src/tutorial.md), clone this repository and run the code locally, or open it up [in FP Complete's online Haskell IDE](https://www.fpcomplete.com/user/eightyeight/simple-concurrency) to edit and run the code yourself.
