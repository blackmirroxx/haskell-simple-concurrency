# Simple concurrency in Haskell

This repository contains translations of [Go By Example](http://gobyexample.com)'s concurrency chapters, as well as a lengthy tutorial which builds the reader up to them in much the same way as Go By Example.
The tutorial is [here](./Tutorial.md), and you can clone this repository in FP Complete's online Haskell IDE to edit and run the code [here](https://www.fpcomplete.com/user/eightyeight/simple-concurrency).
